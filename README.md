PROJECT TITLE: File Integrity Monitoring System

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

File Integrity Monitoring System using Python

Objective:
To detect unauthorized modification of sensitive files by continuously calculating and comparing cryptographic hashes.

Technology Used:

* SHA-256
* Python
* OS File Monitoring

Working:
The system reads a target file, generates its hash, and periodically checks for changes. If the file is altered, added, or deleted, the hash changes, triggering an alert.

Applications:

* Malware detection
* Ransomware prevention
* Security monitoring
* Digital forensics
* Detecting unauthorized access

Conclusion:
This project successfully demonstrates how integrity monitoring protects system files by using cryptographic hashing techniques.
